## Installation

To get started with these algorithms, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms.git
```

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own Python file. You can run any algorithm by navigating to the folder and executing the Python file. For example, to run the Bubble Sort algorithm:

```bash
cd sorting
python bubble_sort.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an algorithm that you would like to add or an improvement to an existing one, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the coding guidelines and include appropriate comments and documentation.


Happy coding!
